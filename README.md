# Mind Tree Payment Integration Demo

This project is a **demonstration Kotlin Spring Boot microservice** designed to showcase backend development skills, API design, and third-party integration patterns.

## Overview

The service simulates interaction with a **fictional major online digital wallet and payment processor**, exposing RESTful endpoints for payment-related operations. While the processor is mocked for demonstration purposes, the structure and logic reflect real-world enterprise service design.

## Features

- ✅ Built with **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot**
- ✅ RESTful API with clean, testable architecture
- ✅ Simulated integration with a major payment processor
- ✅ Environment-based configuration for flexible deployments

## Purpose

This project is intended as a **technical portfolio piece** and may be shared with recruiters or hiring teams. It demonstrates backend proficiency in:

- Service design and API layering
- Kotlin and Spring Boot frameworks
- Integration with external systems
- Testable and maintainable code practices

## Notes

- This is **not a production service** — it contains no real credentials or live payment connections.
- Includes placeholder configs for demonstration only.
